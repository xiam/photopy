# Scanvenger

Scanvenger is a command line tool that imports media files into a nice directory
layout.

```
brew install libexif exiftool
```

Example:

```
scanvenger -from /media/UsbStick -to ~/Photos -max-procs 3 -dry-run -try-exiftool
```

The directory layout is guessed from the EXIF creation date. EXIF metadata is
provided by `libexif` or `exiftool`.

This is an example of how the final directory layout would look like:

```
cd ~/Photos
find .
.
./2011
./2011/03-March
./2011/03-March/06-Sunday
./2011/03-March/06-Sunday/092033-ABC2.jpg
./2011/03-March/06-Sunday/092229-DC31.jpg
./2011/03-March/13-Sunday
./2011/03-March/13-Sunday/021937-C2EB.jpg
./2011/03-March/13-Sunday/040807-95A3.jpg
./2011/03-March/13-Sunday/040823-9CD8.jpg
./2011/10-October/25-Tuesday
./2011/10-October/25-Tuesday/214139-C762.jpg
./2011/10-October/25-Tuesday/214342-3619.jpg
...
```

## Getting exiftool

If you want `scanvenger` to be able to read metadata for almost any kind of file
(not just photos) you'll need `exiftool`. Download and install it from
